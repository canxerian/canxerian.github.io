        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Each month, NASA captures satellite images showing the extent and
          volume of Arctic sea ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built a 3D visualiser using WebGL (BabylonJS) and React to quickly
          assess trends and stories in that data
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>
          These datasets are vast and complex, and navigating them can be
          challenging—especially for those without specialized training or tools
          to interpret the data effectively. While traditional visualizations
          like 2D graphs and charts are helpful, they don't fully convey the
          spatial nature of Arctic sea ice data. My goal is to experiment with a
          more immersive, 3D visualization—almost like a game—to make this data
          more intuitive and accessible.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Technical Process</h2>
        <p>
          The source dataset consists of two key elements: gradient-based images
          representing ice distribution, and numerical values for ice extent and
          volume. However, these elements are stored in multiple folders and
          files, making comparisons time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          To streamline this, I transformed the data so it could be read quickly
          in React. As users scroll, the relevant satellite image updates
          instantanousely, allowing quick interrogation of large volumes of
          data.
