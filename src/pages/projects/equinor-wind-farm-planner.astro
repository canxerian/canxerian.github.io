        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>
          The 3D Offshore Wind Farm Planner is a web-based application developed for Equinor, a global leader in
          offshore wind energy. The tool allows users to design and visualize offshore wind farm layouts in an
          interactive 3D environment directly in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built using WebGL (Babylon.js), React, and Azure, the application helps stakeholders explore different turbine
          placements, distances, and configurations while considering real-world geographic and environmental factors.
          The 3D visualisation enhances decision-making by making complex spatial data accessible and intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project demonstrates the power of immersive web technologies in supporting large-scale renewable energy
          planning and showcases how modern cloud infrastructure can deliver high-performance 3D experiences to a global
          audience.

        <h2>Collaborating with an energy leader</h2>
        <p>
          Working closely with Equinor, one of the world's leading energy companies, our team ran collaborative
          workshops across multiple countries to align on vision, gather feedback, and refine the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We partnered with both in-house stakeholders—including energy analysts, engineers, and product leads—and
          external designers and developers to ensure the solution met real-world operational needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This cross-functional, international collaboration helped us shape a tool that is not only technically robust
          but also deeply informed by the practical challenges of offshore wind farm planning.

        <h2>My contribution</h2>
        <p>My role focused on:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>
            WebGL Development: Built and optimized interactive 3D scenes using Babylon.js to ensure smooth performance
            and accurate spatial visualization.
          </li>
          <li>React Development: Integrated complex 3D components seamlessly into a React-based web interface.</li>
          <li>
            User Interface Design: Designed intuitive user interactions and UI components to support an accessible and
            engaging planning experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The project showcases how immersive web technologies can support renewable energy initiatives and complex infrastructure
        planning at scale.
